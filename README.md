# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal web developer portfolio, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects as a developer. This portfolio is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a modern utility-first CSS framework. Additionally, Framer Motion is used for animations to create a smooth and interactive user experience. 

--This was a project to both create a personal website along with technologies mentioned above
